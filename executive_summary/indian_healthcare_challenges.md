## Indian Healthcare Challenges {#indian-healthcare-challenges}

Indian healthcare faces many problems. These include:

*   Unavailability of adequate trained manpower in rural and poor communities in underserved areas, compounded by high cost of hiring qualified healthcare personnel
*   Healthcare personnel in remote areas are not easy to monitor, and as a result absenteeism and poor performance is rampant
*   Lack of continuity in care of patients (missed history details, duplication of tests)
*   Private healthcare providers have not been fully utilized for public health
*   Inadequate role of insurers in healthcare sector
*   Inefficient government insurance schemes
*   Insurance frauds
*   Lack interoperability between digital healthcare systems. As a result, data remains trapped in silos, not benefiting the patient, and unavailable for large scale research or for framing data-based policies.
*   Increased cost of care to people, payer organizations and the nation

## General Project Management Considerations {#general-project-management-considerations}

*   Overarching goal: To create an ecosystem for healthcare IT to improve Indian healthcare
*   Not a top-down, command-control approach
*   A project in the true spirit of the open source philosophy
*   Form an advisory group of domain experts, and a developers’ group
*   Task the groups to stipulate (exploiting existing body of knowledge modified for India’s need):
    *   Requirements
    *   Standards
    *   Characteristics of the core modules
    *   A Framework
    *   Guiding principles for ongoing development/project management
*   Create mechanisms for ongoing communication between the members of the groups
*   Encourage participation by private companies, including tax incentives for participation in the project
*   Developers create components compliant with the requirements but based on their own needs/innovations

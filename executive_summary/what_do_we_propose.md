## What do we propose? {#what-do-we-propose}

Many of these problems can be dealt with, in great measure, by exploiting information technology. We propose that India undertake development of a **National Electronic Medical Record System** (NEMRS).

We propose creating an open source software development project, along with an ecosystem, in which the NEMRS can be developed with contribution from the private sector, institutions and independent software developers.

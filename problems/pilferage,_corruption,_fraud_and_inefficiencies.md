## Pilferage, Corruption, Fraud and Inefficiencies {#pilferage-corruption-fraud-and-inefficiencies}

Healthcare, with its distributed nature, is prone to all the maladies that have plagued Indiaâ€™s food distribution network and similar government schemes. With an EMR system that is created around Blockchain technology, not only the disbursement of money can be made closest to the point where it is needed, monitoring of drugs and supplies linked with their utilization, as documented in patient-records will help overcome pilferages and frauds significantly.

In the same category, perhaps we can include, the conflicts of interest that many providers have because of things such as gifts and payments from the pharmaceutical companies, or kickbacks they receive for referral to hospitals and specialists. Given an EMR, it will be easy to audit such conflicts of interest.

Each state that implements such scheme has to create its own software system(s), to manage different aspects of healthcare, which are often poorly designed and buggy, creating an additional layer of inefficiency and inaccuracies.

## Flexible and Composable {#flexible-and-composable}

Each feature of the system, down to the user interface elements, should be a standards-based modular component, allowing it to be used with other modules to compose a system that is tailored to the needs of any kind of health organization, and yet be interoperable with all other systems following same standards or built using the same approach. The effort should be to create a system with such high degree of end-user-friendly composability that it would allow even non-technical persons to create a useful system for their own use, or for use by their organization. This composability should cover the data used in the system, clinical decision support, workflow, and every aspect of the user-interface.

This approach is possible if the system is built from the ground up to be knowledge-based (as discussed above) with each component conforming to a set of international health data standards, and NEMRS specific standards for such components.

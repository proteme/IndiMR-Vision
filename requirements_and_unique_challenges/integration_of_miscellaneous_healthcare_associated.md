## Integration of Miscellaneous Healthcare Associated Processes {#integration-of-miscellaneous-healthcare-associated-processes}

Just as the healthcare sector involves many stakeholders and players, the healthcare delivery effort itself involves numerous processes, some of which are not specifically related to clinical care of the patients. Such processes include, inventory management, personnel management, financial management etc. Even cold-chain maintenance for vaccines and certain drugs is crucial. Instead of creating separate systems for each of these, it will be best to tie up monitoring and control of these processes with the core process of healthcare, the clinical care process. NEMRS will allow creating a coherent system tying up all these processes together, increasing efficiencies and reducing errors, malpractice and fraud.

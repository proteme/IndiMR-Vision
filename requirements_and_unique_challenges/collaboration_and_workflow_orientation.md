## Collaboration and Workflow Orientation {#collaboration-and-workflow-orientation}

An electronic solution for a diverse workforce should enable continuity of care across different doctors or healthcare organizations anywhere in the country. The solution should serve as a hub for handover of the patientâ€™s care seamlessly.

It should allow different members of a workforce to take over care of a patient from the previous provider, if the role of the provider matches. This will also allow teams of different organizational units to form ad hoc, and temporary collaborations, with the aim to improve the healthcare of individuals or communities.

The system should serve as a hub for collaboration between experts and remote health workers, in a manner that the person closest to the patient is able to provide the highest possible level of care even in absence of a qualified doctor or a specialist at the location.

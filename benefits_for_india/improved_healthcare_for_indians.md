## Improved Healthcare for Indians {#improved-healthcare-for-indians}

A national EMR will take Indian healthcare up a notch by providing a reliable, continuous, lifelong health record for every citizen. This will improve medical care and reduce costs.  The costs are reduced by avoiding duplication of lab and radiological tests, and by quicker diagnoses being made by caregivers. Doctors will be able to track a patientâ€™s record from womb to tomb.

As the economy improves, people are more likely to move from region to region for business, jobs or for pleasure. The National EMR will ensure that a mobile population has continuity in their healthcare. A patient entrusting his care to a new facility, will be sure that his new doctors can start off exactly from where the care from previous providers stopped.

Additionally, availability of executable clinical decision support system that is constantly updated with the latest evidence-based knowledge will ensure that the patients receive care that is in keeping with the best practices, ushering in an era of evidence-based, standardized high-quality care.
